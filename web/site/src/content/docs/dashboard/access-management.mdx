## User Access Management in Ethereal Nexus

Ethereal Nexus provides two primary methods for granting access to project APIs:
1. **User-based access using API Keys**
2. **OAuth authentication using Client ID, Client Secret, Subject, and Issuer**

Both methods ensure secure communication between clients and the Ethereal Nexus platform.

### **Choosing the Right Authentication Method**

| Method  | Best For | Authentication Header |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **API Keys** | User-based authentication, CLI, and CMS connectors | `Authorization: apikey <your-api-key>` |
| **OAuth (Client Credentials)** | Secure system-to-system authentication | `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>` |

## 1. User-Based Access with API Keys

API Keys provide a simple and effective way to authenticate users for interacting with the Ethereal Nexus API. These keys are linked to a specific user account and allow fine-grained access control.

### **Generating an API Key**

Follow these steps to generate an API key for a user:

1. Log in to the **Ethereal Nexus Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **User Settings** by clicking on your profile.
3. Select the **API Keys** tab.
4. Click on **Create New API Key**.
5. Enter an alias for the API Key and define the required permissions.
6. Select the projects the API Key should have access to.
7. Click **Generate Key** and securely store it, as it will only be shown once.

### **Manually using an API Key**

To authenticate API requests using an API Key, include it in the request header:

```http
Authorization: apikey <your-api-key>
```

**Example request using `curl`**:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: apikey your-api-key" \
     -X GET https://api.ethereal-nexus.com/projects
```

## 2. OAuth Authentication

OAuth provides a secure way to authenticate and authorize requests using a **Client ID, Client Secret, Subject, and Issuer**. This method is recommended for system-to-system authentication and external applications.

### **OAuth Configuration**

To use OAuth authentication, you need the following details:

- **Issuer** ‚Äì The Issuer URL of the OAuth server.
- **Client ID** ‚Äì The identifier for the application requesting access.
- **Client Secret** ‚Äì A secure secret used to authenticate the client.
- **Issuer** ‚Äì The URL of the OAuth server (e.g., Keycloak).
- **Subject** ‚Äì The identity that is being authenticated.

### **Setting Up OAuth Access**

1. Obtain the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your OAuth provider.
2. Configure the **OAuth Service** in Ethereal Nexus:
   - Create a new user, under **Users** > **Invite User**.
   - Select Service User.
   - Fill the details and click Create user.

### **Assign the service user to the project**
1. Navigate to the project settings.
2. Under the **Users** tab, click on **Add User**.
3. Click **Add User** and select the service user you created.
4. Assign the **Can Read** permissions to the service user.

### **Manually using OAuth for API Requests**

To authenticate API requests using OAuth, obtain an access token and include it in the request header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

**Example request using `curl`**:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token" \
     -X GET https://api.ethereal-nexus.com/projects
```


## **Security Considerations**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Never expose API Keys or Client Secrets in public repositories or frontend applications.

- **Use short-lived access tokens** whenever possible for OAuth authentication.
- **Restrict API Key permissions** to the minimum necessary for the user‚Äôs role.
