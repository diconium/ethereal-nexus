title: Introduction
description: Why did we create Ethereal Nexus project?
---

Ethereal Nexus is a groundbreaking project designed to facilitate the integration of remote components into different CMS system (e.g. Adobe Experience Manager ), whether on-premises or on the cloud.
This innovative approach empowers authors to seamlessly include remote components created with modern frontend technologies while offering them the same experience as traditional components.

Key Objectives:

- **Seamless CMS Integration:** Ethereal Nexus bridges the gap between CMS and modern web development, allowing authors to harness the full potential of remote components while maintaining the familiar authoring experience.

- **Modular and Scalable Applications:** By hosting UI elements on remote servers, Ethereal Nexus enables the development of modular, scalable web applications that adapt to evolving requirements.

- **Full Component Lifecycle Management:** The project includes a dashboard that empowers you to manage the complete lifecycle of your remote components, from creation and deployment to activation and retirement.

- **Reuse and Consistency:** Ethereal Nexus promotes component reusability across different projects, and systems, ensuring consistency in your user interfaces and accelerating development.

## Implementation Examples

To help you understand how to work with remote components, we provide two implementation examples:

1. **React + Vite + TypeScript Example:** In the `react-vite-typescript-example` directory, you'll discover a more complex implementation using React, Vite, and TypeScript. This example illustrates how you can build a robust web application with modern tools while incorporating remote components.
2. **Simple HTML Example:** In the `simple-html-example` directory, you'll find a basic HTML page demonstrating how to import and use remote components directly in a simple web application.

Each implementation example comes with its own README, guiding you through setup and usage.

## Modular and Scalable Applications

Ethereal Nexus reimagines the development of web applications, making them modular and scalable without requiring full expertise in the CMS.
In this context, "modular" means that you can create and manage individual UI components as self-contained units, and "scalable" signifies the ability to effortlessly expand your application's capabilities as your needs evolve.

### Empowering Frontend Developers

With Ethereal Nexus, we empower frontend developers to take the lead in creating and maintaining remote components.
You no longer need an extensive background in the CMS ecosystem to develop new components.
You can reuse the same components on different CMS, without having to rewrite them for each platform.
Frontend developers can leverage their skills in modern web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular libraries like React, Vue, or Angular.

### Component Reusability

The modular approach allows you to build and reuse components across different projects. Once you've developed a remote component, it becomes a building block that can be effortlessly integrated into various applications. This reusability not only accelerates development but also ensures consistency in your user interfaces.

### Independent Development and Deployment

Developing components independently of your main application and deploying them on remote servers simplifies the development process.
It minimizes potential conflicts and dependencies, providing greater flexibility to frontend developers.
