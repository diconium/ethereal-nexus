# Dashboard Authentication

This section provides detailed documentation on the authentication methods used in the dashboard project. Each method is described separately with the corresponding environment variables and their explanations.

## JWT Session

Ethereal nexus uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to create the authentication sessions.

When a user signs in, a JWT is created in an HttpOnly cookie. The JWT is encrypted with a secret key known only to the server and setup using the `NEXT_AUTH_SECRET` variable, making it secure even if stolen. The token has a short expiration time, enhancing security.

When a user signs out, the JWT is deleted from the cookies, ending the session.

## API Keys

API keys are essential for integrating with third-party APIs or services, allowing you to authenticate as a specific user within Ethereal Nexus. These keys are generated on a per-user basis, similar to email and passwords, and are intended to represent a single user.

For instance, if you have an external application or service that needs to perform protected actions within Ethereal Nexus, you must first create a user account, then you can generate an API key for that user account, which can be used to authenticate requests to the Ethereal Nexus API.

These API keys are used on the CLI and on the CMS connectors, since these tools consume the API and this is their only authentication method.


### Create an API Key

To create an API key, navigate to your user page and follow the instructions to generate a new key.

##### Navigate to Your User Page:
  - Log in to the Ethereal Nexus dashboard.
  - Click on your user profile or navigate to the user settings page.

##### Access the API Keys Section:
- On your user page, find and click on the "Api Keys" tab.

##### Generate a New API Key:
- Click the "Create Key" button.
- Fill in the required details, such as the alias for the API key and the permissions you want to assign.
- Select the projects you want to give permissions to with this API key.

##### Save the API Key:
- After filling in the details, click the "Continue" button.
- The new API key will be generated and displayed. Make sure to copy and store it securely, as it will not be shown again.

By following these steps, you can create and manage API keys for secure access to the Ethereal Nexus system.

## Authentication Methods

Ethereal Nexus supports various authentication methods to ensure secure access to the dashboard. Each method is designed to cater to different user preferences and security requirements.
