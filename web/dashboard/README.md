## Project Overview

The Dashboard module is an integral part of our project, serving the following key functions:

- **Component Lifecycle Management:** It allows you to create, deploy, activate, and retire components hosted remotely.

- **Component Update API:** An API is provided to programmatically update components while your application is running.

- **CLI for Component Updates:** You can also use a command-line interface (CLI) to update components directly while building your project.

- **Built with Next.js:** The dashboard itself is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for server-rendered applications.

- **Data Storage with MongoDB:** To maintain component metadata and manage their lifecycle, we use a MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    Accessing the Dashboard
    To access the Dashboard, follow these steps:
    
    1. Start the Next.js server:
     ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
    2. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 or the appropriate URL where the Dashboard is hosted.

### Component Lifecycle Management
   Within the Dashboard, you can manage the lifecycle of your remote components. This includes creating, deploying, activating, and retiring components as needed. Use the intuitive user interface to accomplish these tasks.

### Component Update API
The Dashboard provides a RESTful API to programmatically update components. You can send HTTP requests to this API to trigger updates as required. Refer to the API documentation for details on available endpoints and usage.

### Updating Components via CLI
For updating components directly while building your project, use the command-line interface (CLI). Refer to the documentation of the CLI tool for specific commands and options.

### Database Configuration

The Dashboard relies on a MongoDB database for data storage. Ensure that your MongoDB server is correctly configured and running. The connection details can be configured within the project settings.

### Versioning
