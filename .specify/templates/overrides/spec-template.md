# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`

**Created**: [DATE]

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Non-Functional Requirements *(include when relevant)*

<!--
  Include this section when the feature has meaningful constraints around security,
  accessibility, performance, reliability, or observability. Remove it entirely for
  trivial internal-only features where none of these apply.

  NFRs are implementation-agnostic: describe the quality bar, not the technology.
-->

- **NFR-001**: [Accessibility — e.g., "Feature MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast and keyboard navigation standards"]
- **NFR-002**: [Performance — e.g., "Primary user action MUST complete within 2 seconds on a standard connection"]
- **NFR-003**: [Security — e.g., "All data returned MUST be scoped to the authenticated user's permissions"]
- **NFR-004**: [Reliability — e.g., "Feature MUST degrade gracefully when a dependent service is unavailable"]
- **NFR-005**: [Observability — e.g., "Key user actions MUST produce structured log events traceable by session"]
- **NFR-006**: [Compatibility — e.g., "Feature MUST function correctly on the latest two versions of major browsers"]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Functional Success

- **SC-001**: [Measurable outcome — e.g., "Users can complete the primary task without assistance"]
- **SC-002**: [Completion rate — e.g., "90% of users successfully complete the primary flow on first attempt"]

### User Experience Success *(include when UX quality is a stated goal)*

- **SC-003**: [Task speed — e.g., "Users can complete the action in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-004**: [Error recovery — e.g., "Users can recover from all error states without leaving the page"]

### Technical Success *(include when NFRs are defined)*

- **SC-005**: [Performance — e.g., "Feature remains responsive under normal expected load"]
- **SC-006**: [Reliability — e.g., "No data loss occurs when a dependent service is temporarily unavailable"]

## Assumptions

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right assumptions based on reasonable defaults
  chosen when the feature description did not specify certain details.
-->

- [Assumption about target users, e.g., "Users have stable internet connectivity"]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries, e.g., "Mobile support is out of scope for v1"]
- [Assumption about data/environment, e.g., "Existing authentication system will be reused"]
- [Dependency on existing system/service, e.g., "Requires access to the existing user profile API"]
