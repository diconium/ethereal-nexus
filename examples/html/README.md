## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a simple HTML page to import and use remote components in a web application. Key features include:

- Direct usage of remote components without the need for complex build tools.
- Enhanced modularity and scalability for your web application.
- Easy integration with your existing components and HTML pages.

## Usage

To get started with this simple HTML page for importing remote components, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in your preferred code editor or web browser.

3. Customize the HTML file to include the remote components you want to use. You can use HTML's script tag to import your remote component's JavaScript file.

4. Use your remote components within the HTML page by placing the appropriate HTML tags in the page's body or within any specific container.

5. Save and serve the HTML page using a web server or by opening it in a web browser.

## Importing Remote Components

To import your remote components, follow these steps:

1. Include the remote component's JavaScript file using a script tag:

   ```html
   <script src="https://your-remote-component-server.com/your-component.js"></script>
2. Use the custom HTML element representing your remote component:
   ```html
   <your-web-component></your-web-component>
3. Customize the component by providing attributes or content within the HTML tags.
   ```html
   <your-web-component data-attribute="value">Component Content</your-web-component>
   ```
4. Your remote component is now part of your HTML page and can be styled and manipulated as needed.

### Versioning

For version control and tracking changes in your remote components, consider using a versioning strategy like semantic versioning (SemVer) and provide access to different versions of your components.
